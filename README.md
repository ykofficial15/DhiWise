Description:

"DhiWise is a handy app you can use on your phone. It helps you keep track of your money goals in an easy way. I built this app using special tools called Flutter and Dart, and it stores information safely using Firebase.

The app is designed to be really organized. It's like having different sections that work together smoothly, so everything is neat and tidy. This makes it easy for the app to run well and for you to use it without any trouble.

One cool thing about DhiWise is how it keeps everything in check. It uses a special way called the Provider model to manage how things change in the app. This makes sure everything stays organized and runs smoothly, making it easier for you to do what you want.

The main idea of DhiWise is helping you reach your money goals. When you open the app, you can set your goals for saving money or anything else you want to achieve. Then, DhiWise breaks down these big goals into small steps you can do every day. This way, you can see your progress easily and know you're getting closer to your goal.

You can put in how much money you save every day, and DhiWise shows you how you're doing. It's like a little guide that helps you save money regularly. It also gives you tips on how to use your money better and reach your goals faster.

Overall, DhiWise is a friendly app that makes managing your money goals simple and fun. It's like a helpful friend guiding you to save money and reach your dreams."
